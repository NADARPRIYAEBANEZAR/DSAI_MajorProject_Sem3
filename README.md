HEART DISEASE ASSISTANT

In recent times, Cardiovascular disease had become the most common disease. The treatment for curing this disease is costlier which by a common man is not affordable. But, we can reduce the cost to some amount i.e. just by predicting the heart disease at early stage and get it cured. Thatâ€™s why, an attempt had been made in this project to build the model with the help of machine learning techniques to predict the heart disease. The key features of this project includes BMI checking, predict the heart disease, and get the info of heart disease with the help of chatbot, etc.. This application is mainly helpful for healthcare sectors for predicting the likelihood of patients getting heart problems with the help of medical information such as blood sugar level, age, sex, blood pressure, etc.. And lastly, The main motto of this project is to provide a user-friendly experience to the users.
